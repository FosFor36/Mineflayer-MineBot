# Hello
### Well, this is just a bot based on mineflayer, which will help you get rid of routine or just speed up some process, but since I will be the only one writing this bot, it will not reach a more release stage anytime soon.
> Please, if you have any ideas for bot functions, write them in the comments.

> [!WARNING]
> So, now it’s probably best to say that the bot as a whole isn’t ready yet, it can’t do anything useful, and the only thing I’ve fully implemented in it is the sync function, which simply moves the bot to the player (not always)

> [!TIP]
> To install the bot, you'll need:
>1. IP address (if you're testing the bot on a server on your PC, leave it as localhost)
>2. Server port
>3. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
>4. [IQ > 35](https://www.123test.com/iq-test/)
## So, if you've found out everything, checked everything, and installed everything, then open the console and enter these lines there.
```
npm install
```
This will install all the necessary libraries for this bot (there are a lot of them, so my condolences to those with bad internet)
```
node bot.js
```
oh yeah, don't forget to set the required IP and Port of your/not your server
